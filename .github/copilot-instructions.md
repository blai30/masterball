## Project specific
- Framework: Next.js 15
- Language: TypeScript 5
- Core packages: Tailwind CSS 4.1, React 19, Bun 1.2, TanStack Table, pMap, clsx, lucide-react
- The project is a web application that uses Next.js only for its static exports (SSG) and does not use any server-side rendering (SSR) or API routes in production. Server-side rendering (SSR) is only used for development purposes.
- Favor using `type` over `interface` unless necessary.
- Import just the type from a package when possible, e.g., `import type { MyType } from 'my-package'`.
- Never use require, always use import.
- Do not `import React from 'react'`.
- Avoid using `any`, `unknown`, or `object` types. Use specific types or generics instead.
- Avoid if-else chains, use Record or Map for faster lookups.
- Avoid adding redundant comments for self-documenting code, or comments that state the obvious.
- Use `const` for variables that are not reassigned, and `let` only when necessary.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling, and avoid inline styles.
- Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` to optimize performance when necessary.
- Use `clsx/lite` package for conditional class names. Avoid using string interpolation for class names.
- Use `pMap` for parallel processing of arrays.
- Ensure best practices.
- Ensure the best robust, clean, readable code style and architecture.
- Ensure the solution is scalable.
- Try to suggest/find better approaches than what is already given or existing when asked to do something, see if there is a better way to do it instead of just doing it the way it was asked.
- Ensure the user experience and developer experience is kept at a high quality.
- Favor the official/correct/proper way to do things over hacky ways.
- Offer ways to improve the code or architecture whenever possible, even if it means changing existing code.
- Offer ways to improve performance whenever possible.
